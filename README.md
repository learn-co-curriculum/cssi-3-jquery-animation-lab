# Lab - When Pigs Fly
There are some basic jQuery events in my_script.js, and a cute image of a pig in pig.html. Open this repo on Github and clone these files onto your local machine.

## Step 1: Add a New Pig
Use CSS styling to add a new pig to the right of your current pig. Should you use position? float? inline-block?

## Step 2: Animate the Pigs when you Click the Button
Right now the pigs just disappear. You want them to fade, fly and zoom. Check out the animate documentation to get this to happen. 

## Step 3: Removing the Buttons
Use What you learned about jQuery events to have the pigs animate when you click on the images themselves, not the button

## Step 4: Remove the Hive Mind
Right now both pigs behave the same way, they animate when you click either image. Change this so that each pig acts independently from one another
